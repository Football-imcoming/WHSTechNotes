The New Cell Phone Law. I think its stupid that you can't use your phones at lunch. I understand why you can't use it in class. But why not at lunch. Nobody wants to look at everyone while eating. And when there's a school shooting I think it'll be easier for kids to have their phones to contact the police and talk to their parents to make them more comfortable. I just think that school would be boring without a phone.

The career that i am intersted in is engineering. The reason why I picked engineering is because, you can build, and test things. Computer science can help with that because it teaches us to do coding and technology has something tom do with it. Building cars has something to do with technology. In the video I saw a robot pick a piece of a car. Engineering makes more sense because computer science helps with coding.

A game that I think will help schools are fun learning games. Games that are fun for learning like kahoot, and blooket makes it more interesting. The app would be helpful cause kids would actually try to learn because the app is fun. A game has a con tho, kids would be more distracted during school. I think it would help by making them smart.
