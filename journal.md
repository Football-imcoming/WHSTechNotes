The New Cell Phone Law. I think its stupid that you can't use your phones at lunch. I understand why you can't use it in class. But why not at lunch. Nobody wants to look at everyone while eating. And when there's a school shooting I think it'll be easier for kids to have their phones to contact the police and talk to their parents to make them more comfortable. I just think that school would be boring without a phone.
