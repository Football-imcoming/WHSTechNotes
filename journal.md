Claim- the New Cell Phone Law, Evidence- is that it is stupid that you can't use it at lunch I understand why you can't use it in class, but why can't you use it at lunch, and when there's a school shooting it'll be easier for kids to have thei phones to contact the police and talk to their parents. Reasoning- I just think that school would be boring without a phone.
